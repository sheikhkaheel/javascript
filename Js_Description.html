        A problem came in the submition of form tag as it was validated from the server i.e when the user used to submit
        the form.He had to fill it again from the start beacuse user may have forgotten/written wrong form details
        because of this user faced problem while filling form.At that time Netscape was popular browser company
        therefore the CEO of Netscape Company told his manager(Brendan Eich) to deal with this problem.So he created a
        language in ten days called Livescript to communicate with the DOM,so that form could be validated before
        submiting.In order to offically use this language they had to get the permission from the WC3 head Tin Burner
        Lee.WC3 approved it and script tag was created to use livescript in Html.Netsape did a licensed agreement with
        the Sun company and changed livescript to javascript.Javascript got popluar but at that time Microsoft was the
        Tech Giant also created a language called vbscript and jscript because of this in script tag type attribute was
        added to use both of the languages.As Operating system was from Microsopt Netscape knowed that their is no
        future for javascript so they sold it offically to Ecma NGO.Javascript got offically registered in UN because of
        this javascript got popular and was installed in all browsers.JavaScript is a mixture of languages
